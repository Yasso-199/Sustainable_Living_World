                    <h3>What's the Goal here?</h3>
                    <h4>Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all</h4>
                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the world was already off-track to achieve its education targets. If no additional measures are taken, only one in six countries will meet SDG4 and achieve universal access to quality education by 2030. An estimated 84 million children and young people will still be out of school and an estimated 300 million student will still not have the basic numeracy and literacy skills they need to succeed in life. To deliver SDG4, education systems must be re-imagined, and education financing must become a priority national investment.
